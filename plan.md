# BLOG

# Blog items are contained in Cards and contain title, author information, category/tag info, date of edition, and actual content. ✔️

# tags are listed in the right side of the page, I am to implement search in a tag list and filtering by tag. ✔️

# the same plan is for authors. I don't plan to invent the whole bunch of authors just to show my creativity, but few will be enough to make the skill visible. Moreover, I won't to implement nested routing for authors, so that the visiter may come to his page and see some info about the author and his articles in our blog. ✔️

# For the moment some dummy articles are ok, but when I will end up with the mock-page, I will try to use some backend along with REST APIs to fetch articles from the remote database. ✔️

# It requires some backend specific knowledge, security first. ❓

# RECOMMENDATIONS

# Recommendations shall be divided into categories. Films, books, computer games (Dishonored, Bloodborn, We Happy Few, etc.), internet resources for programming and other resources (history, theology, open culture). ✔️

# All of these should state another collection on a firebase, but I am not certain if I want to make it manageable. Meditate on this concern. ✔️

# A user should be able to access the chosen category by clicking one of the material ui select options ✔️

# Layout? I suppose in the top part of the page there will be a bar with a search field and category select, nothing too complicated, just searching and filtering the content. ✔️

# The content will be stored in an array and will contain image, title, like-it button and hover description? ✔️

# Think on how to store images locally, is it necessary to send em on firebase, or containing them locally will do. Is it any necessity to send any of items to firebase? And how to map images, if they are stored locally and not in db string values? ✔️

# fix recoms on homepage ✔️

# add form for managing the content in recom about section. Try to make spans manageable
